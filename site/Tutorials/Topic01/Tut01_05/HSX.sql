Q1: 
Total box office earnings to date, for each movie that had new earnings last week. 
You will also need a subquery here - find which movies that had earnings last week (use dynamic date filtering). 
Your outer query can then aggregate the total earnings for each of the movies identified by your subquery.

Q3:
For each trader and each security, the number of securities currently held, and the date and time of the last trade made. 
Use conditional aggregation to make this easier. 
Make sure you investigate the way the data is recorded, rather than making a (wrong) assumption. 
Note that in the stock trading world, Buy and Short open or extend holdings, whereas Sell, Cover and Delist close out holdings.
